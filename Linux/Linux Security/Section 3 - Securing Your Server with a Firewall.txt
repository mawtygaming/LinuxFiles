Things to do:
==========
IP Tables:
	Tables
		* Filter - default or main table packet filtering - whenever no table assigned automaticc on filter table
		* NAT - role network address translation
		* Mangle - Modify IP headers
		* Raw - Connection Tracking
		* Security - SELinux Taging
	Chains
		* Pre Routing - incoming packet, before taking any routing decision
		* Input - when packet enters network stacck
		* Forward - Packet routed through the system
		* Output - packet originated from your system and going out
		* Post Routing -after routing decision and packet going on wire
		
			Append
			Delete
			Insert
			Replace
			Zero Counters
			List
			Policy
			Rename
			Flush
			New User defined chain
			Delete chain
	Rules
		Matching Component:
		* Protocol
		* IP Address
		* Port Address
		* Interfaces
		* Headers
		Target Component:
			Terminating Target
				- Accept
				- Drop
				- Queue
				- Reject
				- Return
				- User-Defined
			Non-Terminating Target
				- Continue the chain
				
	3Ps:
		* Packets
		* Protocol
		* Ports
				
	COMMANDS:
		sudo iptables -L -n -v
			-L = list
			-n = numeric format
			-v = verbose
		sudo iptables -t mangle -L -n -v
		
		iptables -t[table] -OPTIONS[Chain] [Matching Component] [Action componen]
			
			[Matching component]
			Generic:
				p - protocol
				s - source IP
				d - destination IP
				i - IN interface
				o - OUT interface
			Implicit:
				TCP
					sport
					dport
					tcp-flags
			Explicit:
				-m = match extensions
					conntrack
					dscp
					ecn
					iprange
					
			[Action component]
			-j = jump
				Accept - accept packet and end traversing
				Drop - drop the packet and end traversing
				Reject - drop the packet and response to the source
				Return - to stop packet traverse in the sub chain and return to the superior chain with no effect
		
		Block a website:
			sudo iptables -A INPUT -s [ip address/domain name] -j DROP   #this method is only possible on domain with
																			one servers unlike google or youtube who have multiple servers
				-A = append
			sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
				-P = policy
				
		Delete a table:
			sudo iptables -D INPUT 1
				-D = delete
		
		
		
	PS: If(condition==true){
			Do this
		}
		else{
			Continue traverse
		}
