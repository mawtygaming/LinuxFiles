Check the authentication configuration in pg_hba.conf

Usually located on linux - /etc/postgresql/version/main/pg_hba.conf. You should allow authentication for client for specific IP all from all IP addresses:

# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
local     all            postgres        peer

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local     all            all             peer
# IPv4 local connections:
host     all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host     all             all             ::0/0                   md5
#all ips
host     all             all             all                     md5
More information how to set up pg_hba.conf you can find in documentation.

Then you should set up listening on specific port.

You have to find the postgresql.conf. Usually located /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf) file and change the line with listen_address from:

#listen_address = ''
to (don't forget remove # which means comment):

listen_address = '*'
After every step you should restart Postgresql service:

sudo service postgresql restart
After step 2 you should see port 5432 (or 5433) in listening address after netstat command:

netstat -ntlp
After that you have to open port for PostgreSQL in firewall:

sudo ufw allow 5432
You can check firewall settings with (you should see 5432 in the list):

sudo ufw status
If any of the previous step doesn't work you should check if PostgreSQL is not running on different port (usually 5433) and repeat the previous steps.

This happens very often when you have more running versions of PostgreSQL or you upgrade database and forgot stop the previous version of PostgreSQL.
