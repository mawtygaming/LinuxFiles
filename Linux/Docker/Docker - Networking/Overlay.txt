STEP 1:
* On Docker host 1 
	- docker swarm init
		Get the token
	
	- docker swarm join-token worker
		This is the join token

	- docker swarm join-token manager
		This is the token manager 
		
* docker swarm leave --force

	
Networking Overlay:
* docker swarm init
* docker swarm join --token 
	- This command will be given after initializing docker swarm

STEP 2:
* On Docker host 1
	- docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable network-name
		--driver = your desired driver which is overlay
		--attachable = standalone containers to user-defined overlay networks
		
STEP 3:
* One Docker host 1
	- docker run -it --name container-name1 --network network-name image-name1
		-it = means interactive
		--name = for you container name or it will be random
		--network = overlay network name
	
STEP 4:
* On Docker host 2
	- docker network ls
		You can see that the overlay network-name you created on host 1 doesn't exit yet
		
STEP 5:
* On Docker host 2
	- docker run -dit --name container-name2 --network network-name image-name2
		-d detached
		-it interactive
		network-name = name of the overlay network you've created on host 1
		
STEP 6: 
* On Docker host 2
	- docker network ls
		verify the overlay network created on host 1
		
STEP 7:
* On Docker host 1 
	- docker network inspect network-name
		network-name = name of the overlay network
		Check the containers part
		Check the IP address of container-name1
* On Docker host 2
	- ping the ip address
	or 
	- ping -c 4 container-name1
